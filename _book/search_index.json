You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports; for example, a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). 1.1 Usage Each bookdown chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter must start with a first-level heading: # A good chapter, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading. Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: ## A short section or ### An even shorter section. The index.Rmd file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book. 1.2 Render book You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything: Find the Build pane in the RStudio IDE, and Click on Build Book, then select your output format, or select “All formats” if you’d like to use multiple formats from the same book source files. Or build the book from the R console: bookdown::render_book() To render this example to PDF as a bookdown::pdf_book, you’ll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.org/tinytex/. 1.3 Preview book As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in “Preview book”, or from the R console: bookdown::serve_book() "],["hello-bookdown.html", "Chapter 2 Hello bookdown 2.1 A section", " Chapter 2 Hello bookdown All chapters start with a first-level heading followed by your chapter title, like the line above. There should be only one first-level heading (#) per .Rmd file. 2.1 A section All chapter sections start with a second-level (##) or higher heading followed by your section title, like the sections above and below here. You can have as many as you want within a chapter. An unnumbered section Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a {.unnumbered} or the shorter {-} at the end of the heading, like in this section.

Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 3. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 3.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively.

For example, we are using the bookdown package1 (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr2 (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib).

If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 7.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.

This walk-through will go through both with a couple of examples.", " Chapter 8 Chi Squared 8.1 There are two ways to run a Chi Square test. This walk-through will go through both with a couple of examples. Say we had two cohorts, “Control” and “Experimental” set.seed(1) Cohorts &lt;- sample(c(&quot;Control&quot;, &quot;Experimental&quot;), size = 1000, replace = TRUE) Each cohort will also have the binary variable of sex assigned to them, as well as a categorical variable of age ranges. set.seed(2) Sex &lt;- sample(c(&quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;), size = 1000, replace = TRUE) set.seed(3) Age.Range &lt;- sample(c(&quot;20-29&quot;, &quot;30-39&quot;, &quot;40-49&quot;, &quot;50-59&quot;), size = 1000, replace = TRUE) Data.Frame &lt;- as.data.frame(cbind(Cohorts, Sex, Age.Range)) rm(Cohorts, Age.Range, Sex) To test of our two cohorts differ significantly from one another with regards to sex or age range, we use the chi square test of independence. The first step is to create a contingency table from our data (ie a summary table with the number of males and females in each cohort). We will save the contingency table. table(Data.Frame$Cohorts, Data.Frame$Sex) ## ## Female Male ## Control 249 253 ## Experimental 255 243 Cont.Sex &lt;- table(Data.Frame$Cohorts, Data.Frame$Sex) Now, we run the chi square test of independence. Note that continuity correction is typically applied when any of the numbers in the contingency table are below 10 (some say 5). Fisher’s Exact test may also be another option. However, this is a non-issue for our current sample. chisq.test(Cont.Sex, correct = F) ## ## Pearson&#39;s Chi-squared test ## ## data: Cont.Sex ## X-squared = 0.25705, df = 1, p-value = 0.6122 We can do the same thing for the age ranges as we did for sex, even though age ranges has more than two options Cont.Age &lt;- table(Data.Frame$Cohorts, Data.Frame$Age.Range) chisq.test(Cont.Age) ## ## Pearson&#39;s Chi-squared test ## ## data: Cont.Age ## X-squared = 2.2822, df = 3, p-value = 0.5159 The alternative option to the above is to give the chisq.test function two vectors and it will calculate the contingency table behind the scenes. This is obviously less code, but is less straightforward to me and typically you will want to see the contingency table anyways. chi.vectors &lt;- chisq.test(Data.Frame$Cohorts, Data.Frame$Sex, correct = F) chi.vectors$observed ## Data.Frame$Sex ## Data.Frame$Cohorts Female Male ## Control 249 253 ## Experimental 255 243 chi.vectors$expected ## Data.Frame$Sex ## Data.Frame$Cohorts Female Male ## Control 253.008 248.992 ## Experimental 250.992 247.008 chi.vectors$p.value ## [1] 0.6121572 chi.df &lt;- chisq.test(Cont.Sex, correct = F) chi.df$observed ## ## Female Male ## Control 249 253 ## Experimental 255 243 chi.df$expected ## ## Female Male ## Control 253.008 248.992 ## Experimental 250.992 247.008 chi.df$p.value ## [1] 0.6121572 Finally, let’s say that you have the contingency table already in excel and just want to run the chi square test as quickly and easily as possible. You don’t want to manually enter the data into R, and you don’t want to deal with excels statistics functionality.3 Easy! Copy the contingency table into your clipboard (just exclude the row names): Then, run the following (I’ve commented it out because it throws an error, but trust me it works): #Cont.From.Xl &lt;- read.delim(pipe(&quot;pbpaste&quot;)) #chisq.test(Cont.From.Xl, correct = F) References "],["references.html", "References", " References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
